    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Professional Picture.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="Austin Harjo Class of 2026">
    <h3>My name is Austin Harjo. I'm 21 years old and double majoring in Marketing and American Studies at the University of Notre Dame.
       I grew up in Wichita, Kansas, and now my family lives in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. I'm a huge
       <a href="https://www.mlb.com/royals">Kansas City Royals</a> and <a href="https://www.chiefs.com/">Kansas City Chiefs</a> fan! Throughout my childhood I could always be seen swinging a bat or playing catch, as I was a huge baseball fan and player. Senior year of high school was the only other time I seriously persued another sport, as I played tackle football with my best friends for the first time in my life. It was a season that I wouldn't trade the world for, as football at Sedgwick High School was the talk of the town and very serious. My 8 high school bestfriends had played football their wholes lives, and all had wanted me to play since I transferred into the district as a freshman. That season we went 10-1, reaching the final four, the best season in school history. 
During baseball season of my senior year of high school I had to make the tough decision about what to do with my future. I ultimetely ended up chosing to attend the University of Notre Dame on an academic full-ride scholarship through the Questbridge Scholars program, and bypass my lifelong dream of playing collegiate and eventually professional baseball. Although this was an incredibly tough decision, I couldn't be more thankful to attend the University of Notre Dame. This campus is special, and I truly believe it is an educational experience unlike any other because of how tight the Notre Dame community is, and the continued traditions the university has held since its erection. </h3>
    
     <h3> Having gained a love for the game of football in high school, I applied to work for the University of Notre Dame's Football team within the first few weeks of being on campus. Within the first month of school I was hired and haven't looked back, working for my boss Tim in the Video Operations department. At the time of writing, in the next couple of days we will begin fall camp for the 2025 college football season, and our campaign to become National Champions. Working for the Notre Dame Football team is one of the experiences I am most thankful for having the previlege to be a part of as an undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame, and I cannot wait to see what this season has in store for our team! </h3>

    <h2>Senior Summer 2025</h2>
    <h3>This summer I moved into my senior year house in South Bend and am taking two summer classes to catch up on work. Through my first three years of college, I had some tough times, some hard classes, and so I am 6 credit hours (2 regular classes) behind pace to graduate on time. Luckily I was able to find some online summer courses that were just flexible enough for me to complete these 6 credit hours this summer, while also making progress on my degree along the way. This summer I'm working a couple of different part-time jobs to help pay for living expenses as well as to have a productive and growth-based summer. First, I am still working for the football team, filming minipractices and player-run-practices when needed, also going in on some days to cut game film for this season's upcoming opponents. Secondly, I am working a sales job for DoorDash that I started late last spring semester. My work for DoorDash consists of driving to different restaurants and pitching DoorDash to them in the hopes that they will sign onto the platform. I honestly really enjoyed this experience as it was an unpresurred introduction to sales, and the DoorDash sales district is operated at a style that fit my liking and work style. Lastly, at the beginning of summer I joined the "Wag!" app to spend some time making money while hanging out with dogs! During my first month I became great friends with a little Bichon named Pepe, and we always had a great time together! Aside from school and work, I have been trying my hardest to be more active and healthy. I have always been a bigger guy and have always wanted change, but I am committing myself to it now. I know that the life I want to live is not possible in my current shape and condition, and I do not want this to stop me from living my life. So far this summer across about 7 weeks I have lost 25+ pounds and am excited to see where this journey takes me. To be honest, I am the lightest I have been in years and I am proud of the work I put in so far, but know that my health is a lifelong jounrey and something I need to keep a priority moving forward. I have also been super committed to playing as much golf as possible. Being a former baseball player, it was only a matter of time until I transitioned to golf, and I am now hooked. Although I love golf, it is pretty unfortunate to be hooked on because it is such a difficult and tough sport. I started playing golf after my freshman year of college, and am probably about a 20 handicap right now (we need to find a new word for the golf system Professor Walden!), and is one of those things that I will also continue to work on and improve over the course of my life.

       active by going to the gym and golfing often. </h3>
